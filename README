12seconds Client

Project I started in 2009 to create a 12Seconds.tv client for the Danger Hiptop. Application was rejected by Danger citing the community guidelines of 12seconds and their worrying of inappropriate content.

Never finished this, nor updated it when the API was created for 12seconds.
